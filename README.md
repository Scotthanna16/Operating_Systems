# Operating_Systems
Hello, this is my repository for my OS course. There are 3 projects:

The first project is a program that creates a shell. It has all the basic functionality of a regular shell. In addition, the & option will run a command in the background, the && will execute commands back to back in the foreground, and the &&& will execute multiple commands in parallel. The 'exit' command will cause you to exit the shell and kill all the processes. Finally, "CRTL + C' will terminate all foreground processes.

The second project is a scheduling algorithm for a simple OS. The OS now has a weighted scheduling algorithm instead of a basic one. I also added some basic system calls. 

The third project was about locks. We created thread-safe linked lists using mutex locks. This project was done with a friend of mine named Denis Furletov.
